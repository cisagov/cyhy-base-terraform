[![GitHub Build Status](https://github.com/cisagov/cyhy-account/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cisagov/cyhy-account/actions)

This is a generic skeleton project that can be used to quickly get a
new [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov) [Terraform
module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) GitHub
repository started.  This skeleton project contains [licensing
information](LICENSE), as well as [pre-commit
hooks](https://pre-commit.com) and
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) configurations
appropriate for the major languages that we use.

See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html) for more
details on Terraform modules and the standard module structure.
